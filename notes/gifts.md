I want a feature in my application for planning my holiday shopping.

I have a list of people that I want to buy gifts for. Some of them are local, others I will have to mail something.

I want to collect gift ideas for each of them.

Optionally include a link to an example of the idea.
When I decide on one or more gifts, I want to indicate that.

I want to be able to see the full list:

People with their gift suggestions
People I've already bought gifts for can be hidden from the list.
Show only the people I've bought gifts for
